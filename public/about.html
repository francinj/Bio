<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
    I'm Francis C. Njoku, a Web Developer from Nigeria, worked for First March Communication
     in partner with MTNNIG, practically I worked in the telecom network as a Customer Support for 6 years and 9 months then 
     I resigned amicable with the desire to change my line of work to Tech despite not having any cognizance of coding or programming from the past, I was an Art 
     student in my early School days then Studied Office Technology and Management in Akanu Ibiam Federal Polytechnic Unwanna, Afikpo 
     Ebonyi State, Where I was awarded with Diploma in Office Tech and Mgt with few other certificates through online classes due to the nature of
     my job. I believed I can do it since I'm a good problem solver, I’m always the best in everything partake in. My neighbor 
     who is a coding guru dared me to switch career, at that point nothing else interests me to do except beating that challenge, to me it's a challenge and I entertain them a lot. 
     All thanks to Mr. Uyuho Isaac Eduok who inspired me to join the coding and programming line of work.

    I have made some decisions that only 3 of 10 persons could take, today I'm very delighted of those decisions, one of it was deciding 
    to go back and repeat SS1 Note: This decision was on my own, I didn't fail any class or was told by anyone to do so. I will tell you why
     I took the decision in few seconds... I was a brilliant boy in my elementary School (Stephen Success N/P School, Ore Ondo St), my JSS1 to 3 was
      okay but my SSI to SS2 was terrible due to peer group and community I grew and family background also affected me because no 
      one cares as long as you’re helping the family financially, I became someone who will leave the class through the window while the 
      lecture is on, school closing hour was 2 but my friends and I will leave by 12noon just to meet up with “first bus” to sell stuffs like 
      banana, sometimes kola nut, sometimes bottle water and so on... My brother-in-law (I call him Uncle Sam) changed my life for coming to ask my 
      parents he wanted me to live with him. I then relocated to (Epe) in the year 2006, I made the decision of not been admitted into SS3 although
       that’s the class I ought to be, I was extremely lacking behind some knowledge, so I decided to start from SS1, I became the 
       Assistant Senior Prefect on completion of my SS3, from here you can tell that was my turning point. 
    I regained all lost lectures and knowledge.

    of fact I was inspired to travel to Ivory coast by road a 34 hours journey, Kenya, Uganda, Egypt, United Arab Emirate, Togo, Ghana, Republic of Benin and Rwanda to 
    learn about their cultures, so far so good I have been to 9 countries which I'm proud of. Making me the youngest tourister in my Community,

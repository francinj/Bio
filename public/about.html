<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
    I'm Francis C. Njoku, a Web Developer from Nigeria, worked for First March Communication
     in partner with MTNNIG, practically I worked in the telecom industry as a Customer Support for 6 years and 9 months before 
     I resigned amicably with the desire to change my line of work to Tech despite not having any cognizance of coding or programming from the past. I was an Art 
     student in my Senior Secondary School years then Studied Office Technology and Management in Akanu Ibiam Federal Polytechnic Unwanna, Afikpo 
     Ebonyi State. Where I was awarded with Diploma in Office Tech and Mgt with few other certificates through online classes due to the nature of
     my job. I believed I can do it since I'm a good problem solver, I’m always give my best in everything I partake in. My neighbor 
     who is a coding guru dared me to switch career, at that point nothing else interests me to do except beating that challenge, to me it's a challenge and I entertain them a lot. 
     All thanks to Mr. Uyuho Isaac Eduok who inspired me to join the coding and programming line of work.

    I have made some decisions that only 3 of 10 persons could take, today I'm very delighted of those decisions, one of it was deciding 
    to go back and repeat SS1 Note: This decision was on my own, I didn't fail any class or was told by anyone to do so. I will tell you why
     I took the decision in few sentences... I was a brilliant boy in my elementary School (Stephen Success N/P School, Ore Ondo St), my JSS1 to 3 was
      okay but my SSI to SS2 was terrible due to peer group and community I grew and family background also affected me because no 
      one cares as long as you’re helping the family financially, I became someone who will leave the class through the window while the 
      lecture is on, school closing hour was 2pm but my friends and I will leave by 12noon just to meet up with “first bus” to sell stuffs like 
      banana, kola nut and sometimes bottle water etc.. My brother-in-law (I call him Uncle Sam) changed my life by coming to ask my 
      parents to allow me live with him. I then relocated to (Epe) in the year 2006, I made the decision of not been admitted into SS3 although
       that’s the class I ought to be, I was extremely lacking behind, so I decided to start from SS1. I became the 
       Assistant Senior Prefect during the third year of my Senior Secondary Education, from here you can tell that was my turning point. 
    I gained so much knowledge after my decision making.

    Generally life has been fair to me I can't complain, I am proud to say I can unlearn and learn about new thing, cultures and places, as a matter 
    of fact I was inspired to travel by road to Ivory Coast, Republic of Benin, Ghana, Togo and subsequently by air to other countries such as Kenya, Uganda, Egypt, United Arab Emirate and Rwanda to 
    learnt so much about their cultures, so far so good I have been to 9 countries which I'm proud of. Making me the youngest tourister in my Community,
     Ohaozara Local Government of Ebonyi State in the year 2020. All thanks to God who made it possible.
